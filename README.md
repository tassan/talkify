## Background Context

**Talkify** is a TDD Sandbox Project designed to explore and showcase Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles in a real-world application. The goal is to build a robust and scalable real-time chat system while adhering to clean code and agile practices.

This project is inspired by the work shared in the [Optivem Journal](https://journal.optivem.com/) and the insights of [Valentina JemuoviÄ‡](https://substack.com/@valentinajemuovic), encouraging developers to adopt and refine their TDD skills. Check out the links for more details and inspiration.
